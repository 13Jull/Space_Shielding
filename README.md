# Space_Shielding project
This git is for the Space Shielding project. Here you can find all the information that took us almost two years to generate, although a lot would change if we start again today. It was a lot of learning for us, and we hope this is useful for you. Thanks for visiting this git.

## Contents
  - Reports
  - PCBs (for now, only the Space Shielding part, we are working to add the rest of the PCBs of the payload)
  - Codes (Developed codes for the different MCUs)
  - Photos

## Work to be done:
   - [ ] Translate existing files from Spanish to English
   - [ ] Add PCB_Top and PCB_Bottom
   - [ ] Add STM32 Code
   - [ ] Add the MATLAB codes used for the analysis
   - [ ] Add experimental data
   - [ ] Add ANSYS and CAD simulation for shield
   - [ ] More photos of the complete process

## Space Shielding team
